<h2 id="10-introduction">1.0) Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-about-scummvm">1.1) About ScummVM</h3>
<p>ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!</p>
<p>Originally it was designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, such as Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle or Sam and Max. SCUMM stands for 'Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion', which was the first game for which LucasArts designed this system. And much later it gave its name to ScummVM ('VM' meaning Virtual Machine).</p>
<p>Over time support for a lot of non-SCUMM games has been added, and ScummVM now also supports many of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (such as King's Quest 1-7, Space Quest 1-6, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword I and II, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of Kyrandia series, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more. You can find a full list with details on which adventures are supported and how well on the compatibility page. ScummVM is continually improving, so check back often.</p>
<p>Among the systems on which you can play those games are regular desktop computers (running Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...), game consoles (Dreamcast, Nintendo DS &amp; Wii, PSP, ...), smartphones (Android, iPhone, Symbian ...) and more.</p>
<p>At this time ScummVM is still under heavy development. Be aware that whilst we attempt to make sure that many games can be completed with few major bugs, crashes can happen and we offer no warranty. That being said, some of the games have been supported for a long time and should work fine with any recent stable release. You can get a feeling of how well each game is working in ScummVM by looking at the compatibility page. Actually, if you browse a bit around you might discover that ScummVM is even being used commercially to re-release some of the supported games on modern platforms. This shows that several companies are happy with the quality of the software and how well it can run some of the games.</p>
<p>If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop ScummVM easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a patch!</p>
<h3 id="12-quick-start">1.2) Quick start</h3>
<p>For the impatient among you, here is how to get ScummVM running in five simple steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download ScummVM from <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/">https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/</a> and install it.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a directory on your hard drive and copy the game datafiles from the original media to this directory. Repeat this for every game you want to play.</p></li>
<li><p>Start ScummVM, choose 'Add game', select the directory with the game datafiles (do not try to select the datafiles themselves!) and press <code>Choose</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A dialog should pop up allowing you to configure various settings if you wish to (it should be just fine to leave everything at its default, though). Confirm the dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the game you want to play in the list, and press <code>Start</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the future, you should be able to directly skip to step 5, unless you want to add more games.</p>
<p>Hint: If you want to add multiple games in one go, try pressing and holding the shift key before clicking 'Add game' -- its label will change to 'Mass Add' and if you press it, you are again asked to select a directory, only this time ScummVM will search through all subdirectories for supported games.</p>
<h3 id="13-faq">1.3) F.A.Q.</h3>
<p>We've compiled a list of F.A.Q. at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scummvm.org/faq/">https://www.scummvm.org/faq/</a></p>
<h2 id="20-contact">2.0) Contact</h2>
<p>The easiest way to contact the ScummVM team is by submitting bug reports (see section 2.1) or by using our forums at <a href="https://forums.scummvm.org">https://forums.scummvm.org</a>. You can also join and e-mail the scummvm-devel mailing list, or chat with us on IRC (#scummvm on irc.freenode.net) Please do not ask us to support an unsupported game -- read the FAQ on our web site first.</p>

<p>To report a bug, please follow the "Bug Tracker" link from our homepage and log in with your GitHub account. Please make sure the bug is reproducible, and still occurs in the latest git/Daily build version. Also check the known problems list (below) and the compatibility list on our website for that game, to ensure the issue is not already known:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/">https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/</a></p>
<p>Please do not report bugs for games that are not listed as being completeable in the 'Supported Games' section, or compatibility list. We <em>know</em> those games have bugs.</p>
<p>Please include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>ScummVM version (PLEASE test the latest git/Daily build)</li>
<li>Bug details, including instructions on reproducing</li>
<li>Language of game (English, German, ...)</li>
<li>Version of game (talkie, floppy, ...)</li>
<li>Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, ...)</li>
<li>Attach a saved game if possible - If this bug only occurred recently, please note the last version without the bug, and the first version including the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by looking at the changes made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, please report each issue separately; do not file multiple issues on the same ticket. (Otherwise, it gets difficult to track the status of each individual bug).</p>
<h2 id="30-supported-games">3.0) Supported Games</h2>

<pre><code>Moonbase Commander
</code></pre>
<p>Please be aware that the engines may contain bugs and unimplemented features that sometimes make it impossible to finish the game. Save often, and please file a bug report (instructions on submitting bug reports are above) if you encounter such a bug in a 'supported' game.</p>
<h3 id="31-copy-protection">3.1) Copy Protection</h3>
<p>The ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases where the game companies (such as LucasArts) themselves bundled 'cracked' executables with their games -- in these cases the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter bypasses them (similar to what an illegally cracked version might do, only that here the producer of the game did it). There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate and pirated data files, so for the games where we know that a cracked version of the original interpreter was sold at some point, ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy protection.</p>
<p>In some cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try entering any answer. Chances are that it will work.</p>
<p>ScummVM will skip copy protection in the following games:</p>

<h3 id="33-multi-cd-games-notes">3.3) Multi-CD games notes</h3>
<p>In general, ScummVM does not deal very well with Multi-CD games. This is because ScummVM assumes everything about a game can be found in one directory. Even if ScummVM does make some provisions for asking the user to change CD, the original game executables usually installed a small number of files to the hard disk. Unless these files can be found on all the CDs, ScummVM will be in trouble.</p>
<p>Fortunately, ScummVM has no problems running the games entirely from hard disk, if you create a directory with the correct combination of files. Usually, when a file appears on more than one CD you can pick either of them.</p>
<h3 id="34-known-problems">3.4) Known Problems</h3>
<p>This release has the following known problems. There is no need to report them, although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a bug that is not listed here, nor in the compatibility list on the web site, please see the section on reporting bugs.</p>

<p>The most up to date list of Engine data files can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/tree/master/dists/engine-data">source code repository</a></p>
<h3 id="36-blade-runner-notes">3.6) Blade Runner notes</h3>
<p>Supported versions are English (both CD and DVD), French, German, Italian, Russian (by Fargus Multimedia) and Spanish. Other unofficial versions exist but they are based on the English version.</p>
<p>All *.mix, *.tlk and *.dat files are needed from all 4 CDs/DVD. Files named CDFRAMES.DAT need to be renamed to CDFRAMES1.DAT, CDFRAMES2.DAT, CDFRAMES3.DAT and CDFRAMES4.DAT according on the CD they came from. Other files with the same name on different CDs are identical and it doesn't matter which one is used.</p>
<p>To enable subtitles, download a file from our <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/games/#bladerunner">Downloads</a> page and place file SUBTITLES.MIX next to the other game files.</p>
<p>"Blade Runner with restored content" is not yet supported and might contain game breaking bugs.</p>
<h3 id="37-broken-sword-games-notes">3.7) Broken Sword games notes</h3>
<p>The instructions for the Broken Sword games are for the Sold-Out Software versions, with each game on two CDs, since these were the versions most easily available at the time ScummVM gained support for them. Hopefully they are general enough to be useful to other releases as well.</p>
<h4 id="371-broken-sword">3.7.1) Broken Sword</h4>
<p>For this game, you will need all of the files from the clusters directories on both CDs. For the Windows and Macintosh versions, you will also need the speech.clu files from the speech directories, but since they are not identical you will need to rename them speech1.clu and speech2.clu for CD 1 and 2 respectively. The PlayStation version requires the speech.tab, speech.dat, speech.lis, and speech.inf.</p>
<p>In addition, the Windows and Macintosh versions require a music subdirectory with all of the files from the music subdirectories on both CDs. Some of these files appear on both CDs, but in these cases they are either identical or, in one case, so nearly identical that it makes little difference. The PlayStation version requires tunes.dat and tunes.tab.</p>
<h4 id="372-broken-sword-ii">3.7.2) Broken Sword II</h4>
<p>For this game, you will need all of the files from the clusters directories on both CDs. (Actually, a few of them may not be strictly necessary, but the ones that I'm uncertain about are all fairly small.) You will need to rename the speech.clu and music.clu files speech1.clu, speech2.clu, music1.clu and music2.clu so that ScummVM can tell which ones are from CD 1 and which ones are from CD 2. Any other files that appear in both cluster directories are identical. Use whichever you like.</p>
<p>In addition, you will need the cd.inf and, optionally, the startup.inf files from the sword2 directory on CD 1.</p>
<h4 id="373-broken-sword-games-cutscenes">3.7.3) Broken Sword games cutscenes</h4>
<p>The cutscenes for the Broken Sword games have a bit of a history (see the next section, if you are interested), but in general all you need to do is to copy the .SMK files from the "SMACKS" or "SMACKSHI" directories on the CDs to the same directory as the other game data files. (Broken Sword has a "SMACKSLO" directory with the same cutscenes, but these are of lower quality.) You can put them in a subdirectory called "video" if you find that neater.</p>
<p>For the PlayStation versions, you can dump the original videos off the disc. For each of the files ending in an "STR" extension, you should dump them as <em>raw</em> sectors off the disc (all 2352 bytes per sector). You may also use the re-encoded cutscenes mentioned below instead, but this will not work for all videos in Broken Sword II. For more information, see:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-PlayStation_Videos">https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-PlayStation_Videos</a></p>
<p>Some re-releases of the games, as well as the PlayStation version, do not have Smacker videos. Revolution Software has kindly allowed us to provide re-encoded cutscenes for download on our website:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/">https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/</a></p>
<p>These cutscenes are provided in DXA format with FLAC audio. Their quality is equal to the original games due to the use of lossless compression. Viewing these cutscenes requires a version of ScummVM compiled with both FLAC and zlib support.</p>
<p>For systems that are too slow to handle the decoding of FLAC audio, the audio for these cutscenes is also provided separately as OGG Vorbis audio. Viewing these cutscenes with OGG Vorbis audio requires a version of ScummVM compiled with both libVorbis and zlib support.</p>
<p>For Broken Sword, we also provide a subtitles add-on. Simply unpack it and follow the instructions in its readme.txt file. The subtitle pack currently does not work when running PlayStation videos. (Broken Sword II already has subtitles; no extra work is needed for them.)</p>
<h4 id="374-broken-sword-games-cutscenes-in-retrospect">3.7.4) Broken Sword games cutscenes, in retrospect</h4>
<p>The original releases of the Broken Sword games used RAD Game Tools's Smacker(tm) format. As RAD was unwilling to open the older legacy versions of this format to us, and had requested we not reverse engineer it, an alternative solution had to be found.</p>
<p>In Broken Sword II, it was possible to play back the voice-over without playing the video itself. This remained a fallback until ScummVM 1.0.0, but was never the only solution for any stable release.</p>
<p>In ScummVM 0.6.0 we used MPEG, which provided a reasonable trade-off between size and quality. In ScummVM 0.10.0 this was superseded by DXA (originally added for AdventureSoft's "The Feeble Files"). This gave us a way of providing the cutscenes in the exact same quality as the originals, at the cost of being larger.</p>
<p>Finally, in early 2006, the Smacker format was reverse engineered for the FFmpeg project. Thanks to their hard work, ScummVM 1.0.0 now supports the original cutscenes. At the same time, MPEG support was dropped. From a technical standpoint, this was a good thing since decoding MPEG movies added a lot of complexity, and they didn't look as good as the Smacker and DXA versions anyway.</p>
<h3 id="38-day-of-the-tentacle-notes">3.8) Day of the Tentacle notes</h3>
<p>At one point in the game, you come across a computer that allows you to play the original Maniac Mansion as an easter egg. ScummVM supports this, with a few caveats:</p>
<p>ScummVM will scan your configuration file for a game that's in a <code>Maniac</code> sub-folder of your Day of the Tentacle folder. If you've copied the data files from the CD version, this should already be the case but you have to add the game to ScummVM as well.</p>
<p>To return to Day of the Tentacle, press F5 and select "Return to Launcher".</p>
<p>This means that you could in theory use any game as the easter egg. Indeed, there is a "secret" configuration setting, <code>easter_egg</code>, to override the ID of the game to run. Be aware, though, that not all games support returning to the launcher, and setting it up to use Day of the Tentacle itself as the easter egg game is not recommended.</p>
<h3 id="39-dragon-history-notes">3.9) Dragon History notes</h3>
<p>There are 4 language variants of the game: Czech, English, Polish and German. Each of them is distributed in a separate archive. The only official version is the Czech one, and the English, Polish and German ports have always been work in progress and never officially released. Although all texts are fully translated, it is known that some of them contain typos.</p>
<p>There exists an optional Czech dubbing for the game. For bandwidth reasons, you can download it separately and then unpack it to the directory of the game. You can listen to the Czech dubbing with all language variants of the game, while reading the subtitles.</p>
<p>All game files and the walkthrough can be downloaded from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/index-en.html">http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/index-en.html</a></p>
<h3 id="310-flight-of-the-amazon-queen-notes">3.10) Flight of the Amazon Queen notes</h3>
<p>Only the original non-freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen (from original CD), requires the <code>queen.tbl</code> datafile (available from the <code>Downloads</code> page on our website) in either the directory containing the <code>queen.1</code> game data file, in your extrapath, or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>compress_queen</code> tool from the tools package to 'rebuild' your FOTAQ data file to include the table for that specific version, and thus removing the run-time dependency on the <code>queen.tbl</code> file. This tool also allows you to compress the speech and sound effects with MP3, OGG or FLAC.</p>
<h3 id="311-gobliiins-notes">3.11) Gobliiins notes</h3>
<p>The CD versions of the Gobliiins series contain one big audio track which you need to rip (see the section on using compressed audio files) and copy into the game directory if you want to have in-game music without the CD in the drive all the time. The speech is also in that track and its volume is therefore changed with the music volume control as well.</p>
<h3 id="312-inherit-the-earth-quest-for-the-orb-notes">3.12) Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb notes</h3>
<p>In order to run the Mac OS X Wyrmkeep re-release of the game you will need to copy over data from the CD to your hard disk. If you're on a PC then consult:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Mac_Games">https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Mac_Games</a></p>
<p>Although it primarily talks about SCUMM games, it mentions the "HFSExplorer" utility which you need to extract the files. Note that you have to put the speech data "Inherit the Earth Voices" in the same directory as the game data which is stored in:</p>
<p>Inherit the Earth.app/Contents/Resources</p>
<p>For the old Mac OS 9 release you need to copy the files in MacBinary format, as they should include both resource and data forks. Copy all 'ITE *' files.</p>
<h3 id="313-mickeys-space-adventure-notes">3.13) Mickey's Space Adventure notes</h3>
<p>To run Mickey's Space Adventure under ScummVM, the original executable of the game (mickey.exe) is needed together with the game's data files.</p>
<p>There is extensive mouse support for the game under ScummVM, even though there wasn't any mouse support in the original game. Menu items can be selected using the mouse, and it is possible to move to other locations using the mouse as well. When the mouse cursor is hovered on the edges of the screen, it changes color to red if it is possible to walk towards that direction. The player can then simply click on the edges of the game's screen to change location, similar to many adventure games, which is simpler and more straightforward than moving around using the menu.</p>
<h3 id="314-might-and-magic-xeen-games-notes">3.14) Might and Magic Xeen games notes</h3>
<p>To properly play the World of Xeen CD Talkie using original discs, use LAME or some other encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files, either mp3 or ogg. Whichever you choose, the tracks of the first CD should be named from track02 to track31, whereas the second CD's audio tracks should be encoded and renamed as track32 through to track60.</p>
<p>For the GOG Might and Magic 4-5 installation, install the game to your computer, and do the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game1.inst (CUE) and game1.gog (BIN) file from the game folder is a CD image. Use software like Virtual CloneDrive to mount it as a drive. Linux and MacOS users can use bchunk to convert it to an ISO.</li>
<li>Copy all the .cc files from the subfolder in the mounted drive to a new empty game folder that you create for the game.</li>
<li>Copy all the music/*.ogg files from the GOG installation to your game folder. You'll then need to rename all of them from xeen??.ogg to track??.ogg</li>
<li>You should then be able to point ScummVM to this new game folder, and the CD talkie version should be detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Savegames from either Clouds or Darkside of Xeen games can be transferred across to World of Xeen (that combines both games) simply by setting up and detecting World of Xeen (either by manually combining the two games or using the GOG World of Xeen installer), and then renaming the savegames to use the World of Xeen savegame format, by default 'worldofxeen.*'</p>
<p>The Xeen engine also offers two custom options in the Engine tab for the games in the ScummVM launcher. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To change the threshold armor breaks at for characters from -10HP to -80HP</li>
<li>To show values for inventory items, even outside of the blacksmith, allowing the relative strength/value of armor and weapons to be compared.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="315-myst-game-notes">3.15) Myst game notes</h3>
<p>Left Click: Move/action Space: Pause the game Esc: Skip cutscene F5: Menu</p>
<p>Myst will autosave to slot 0 if no save or an autosave is present in slot 0.</p>
<h3 id="316-quest-for-glory-notes">3.16) Quest for Glory notes</h3>
<p>It is possible to import characters, beginning with Quest for Glory II, from past games to future games and continue from the stats earned from those games.</p>
<p>For example, a character can be imported from Quest for Glory I directly to Quest for Glory III without having to necessarily play Quest for Glory II.</p>
<p>Characters cannot be imported from future games to past games, nor can a character be imported to the same game that was just completed. In other words, a character from Quest for Glory II cannot be imported into Quest for Glory II.</p>
<p>If you want to use a saved character from the original Sierra interpreter, you will need to rename the character file to "qfg[game-number]-[character-filename].sav" and place it in the ScummVM save path (see section 6.0), otherwise the file won't get listed on the import screen.</p>
<p>Example: qfg2-thief.sav</p>
<h3 id="317-riven-game-notes">3.17) Riven game notes</h3>
<p>Left Click: Move/action Arrow Keys: Movement Page Up: Look up Page Down: Look down Space: Pause the game Esc: Skip cutscene F5: Menu Ctrl-o: Load game Ctrl-s: Save game</p>
<p>Riven will autosave to slot 0 if no save or an autosave is present in slot 0.</p>
<h3 id="318-simon-the-sorcerer-games-notes">3.18) Simon the Sorcerer games notes</h3>
<p>If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD, you will find the Windows version in the main directory of the CD and the DOS version in the DOS directory of the CD.</p>
<h3 id="319-starship-titanic-game-notes">3.19) Starship Titanic game notes</h3>
<p>For the purposes of solving the starfield puzzle, only mouse clicks, L and Tab are really needed, though the action glyph in the PET can be used instead of Tab.</p>
<h3 id="320-the-curse-of-monkey-island-notes">3.20) The Curse of Monkey Island notes</h3>
<p>For this game, you will need the comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2 files. The comi.la0 file can be found on either CD, but since they are identical it doesn't matter which one of them you use.</p>
<p>In addition, you will need to create a "resource" subdirectory containing all of the files from -both- "resource" subdirectories on the two CDs. Some of the files appear on both CDs, but again they're identical.</p>
<h3 id="321-the-feeble-files-notes">3.21) The Feeble Files notes</h3>
<p>Amiga/Macintosh: You need to install a small pack of cutscenes that are missing in both of these versions of The Feeble Files. It's called "The Feeble Files - Omni TV and epilogue cutscenes for the Amiga and Macintosh versions" and you can get it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scummvm.org/games/#feeble">https://www.scummvm.org/games/#feeble</a></p>
<p>Windows: If you have the Windows version of The Feeble Files, there are several things to note.</p>
<p>Many of the files necessary for the game are stored in an InstallShield file called data1.cab, which ScummVM is unable to unpack. You will need to use the original installer or i5comp to unpack the contents of this file. The i5comp decompression tool, can be found via a search on the internet.</p>
<p>To use the speech files with ScummVM, they need to be renamed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename voices.wav on CD1 to voices1.wav</li>
<li>Rename voices.wav on CD2 to voices2.wav</li>
<li>Rename voices.wav on CD3 to voices3.wav</li>
<li>Rename voices.wav on CD4 to voices4.wav</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="322-the-legend-of-kyrandia-notes">3.22) The Legend of Kyrandia notes</h3>
<p>To run The Legend of Kyrandia under ScummVM you need the <code>kyra.dat</code> file. The file should already be included in official ScummVM packages. In case ScummVM complains that the file is missing you can find it on the <code>Downloads</code> page of the ScummVM website. Note that the current Windows release of ScummVM should contain the file embedded into the executable, thus you only need to grab it in case ScummVM complains about the file being missing.</p>
<h3 id="323-trolls-tale-notes">3.23) Troll's Tale notes</h3>
<p>The original game came in a PC booter disk, therefore it is necessary to dump the contents of that disk in an image file and name it "troll.img" to be able to play the game under ScummVM.</p>
<h3 id="324-winnie-the-pooh-notes">3.24) Winnie the Pooh notes</h3>
<p>It is possible to import saved games from the original interpreter of the game into ScummVM.</p>
<p>There is extensive mouse support for the game under ScummVM, even though there wasn't any mouse support in the original game. Menu items can be selected using the mouse, and it is possible to move to other locations using the mouse as well. When the mouse cursor is hovered on the edges of the screen, it changes color to red if it is possible to walk towards that direction. The player can then simply click on the edges of the game's screen to change location, similar to many adventure games, which is simpler and more straightforward than moving around using the menu.</p>
<h3 id="325-sierra-agi-games-predictive-input-dialog">3.25) Sierra AGI games: Predictive Input Dialog</h3>
<p>The Predictive Input Dialog is a ScummVM aid for running AGI engine games (which notoriously require command line input) on devices with limited keyboard support. In these situations, since typing with emulated keyboards is quite tedious, commands can be entered quickly and easily via the Predictive Input Dialog.</p>
<p>In order to enable predictive input in AGI games, you need to copy the pred.dic file in the ScummVM extras directory or the directory of the game you wish to play. This dictionary has been created by parsing through all known AGI games and contains the maximum set of common words.</p>
<p>If the dictionary is detected, the Predictive Input Dialog is displayed either when you click on the command line area (wherever keyboard input is required, even in dialog boxes), or in some ports by pressing a designated hot key.</p>
<p>The predictive input dialog operates in three modes, switchable by the (*)Pre/123/Abc button. The primary input method is the predictive mode (Pre) which resembles the way "fast typing" is performed at phones. The alphabet is divided into 9 sets which naturally map to the 9 number keys of the numeric keypad (0 is space). To type in a word, you press once the number of the set which contains the letter of the word you intend to type, then move on to the next. For example, to type the command <code>look</code>, you should press 5665. As you gradually type the intended word's numeric code, the dictionary is accessed for known words matching your input up to that point. As you press more keys, the prediction converges to the correct word. This is why the printed word may change dramatically between key presses. There exist situations though where more than one words share the same numeric representation. For example the words <code>quit</code> and <code>suit</code> map to the same number, namely 7848. In these cases the (#)next button lights up. By pressing it, you can cycle through the list of words sharing the same code and finally accept the correct one by pressing (0)space or the Ok button.</p>
<p>The second input method (123) is the numeric input: Each key you press is entered verbatim as a number.</p>
<p>The third input method (Abc) is the Multi-tap Alpha input mode. This mode is intended for entering free text, without assistance from the dictionary scheme of predictive (Pre) mode. The text is entered one letter at the time. For each letter first press the number of the set which contains the letter you want, then use the (#)next button to cycle through the letters and repeat with another number. For example, to enter the word <code>look</code> you must press the following: 5##6##6##5#</p>
<p>The dialog is fully usable with the mouse, but a few provisions have been made in some ScummVM ports to make its use more comfortable by naturally mapping the functionality to the numeric keypad. Also, the dialog's buttons can be navigated with the arrow and the enter keys.</p>
<h3 id="326-sierra-sci-games-simultaneous-speech-and-subtitles">3.26) Sierra SCI games: Simultaneous speech and subtitles</h3>
<p>Certain CD versions of Sierra SCI games had both speech and text resources. Some have an option to toggle between the two, but there are some cases where there wasn't any option to enable both simultaneously. In ScummVM, it is possible to enjoy a combined mode, where both speech and text are shown at the same time. This mode can be toggled in the ScummVM audio options, but each game has different behavior in-game regarding speech and text toggling.</p>
<p>The CD games where speech and subtitles can be shown simultaneously are:</p>

<h3 id="327-zork-games-notes">3.27) Zork games notes</h3>
<p>To run the supported Zork games (Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands and Zork: Grand Inquisitor) you need to copy some (extra) data to its corresponding destination.</p>
<h4 id="3271-zork-nemesis-the-forbidden-lands">3.27.1) Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands</h4>
<p>Download the Liberation(tm) fonts package <a href="https://releases.pagure.org/liberation-fonts/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.00.1.tar.gz">https://releases.pagure.org/liberation-fonts/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.00.1.tar.gz</a> and unpack all the ttf files into your ScummVM extras directory. Alternatively, ScummVM comes with the GNU FreeFont fonts, though at the time of writing these fonts cause some text rendering issues. Download the subtitles patch <a href="https://www.thezorklibrary.com/installguides/znpatch.zip">https://www.thezorklibrary.com/installguides/znpatch.zip</a> and unzip the addon directory into the game root directory</p>
<h4 id="3272-zork-grand-inquisitor">3.27.2) Zork: Grand Inquisitor</h4>
<p>Download the Liberation(tm) fonts package <a href="https://releases.pagure.org/liberation-fonts/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.00.1.tar.gz">https://releases.pagure.org/liberation-fonts/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.00.1.tar.gz</a> and unpack all the ttf files into your ScummVM extras directory.

<h3 id="328-commodore64-games-notes">3.28) Commodore64 games notes</h3>
<p>Both Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken run but Maniac Mansion is not yet playable. Simply name the D64 disks "maniac1.d64" and "maniac2.d64" respectively "zak1.d64" and "zak2.d64", then ScummVM should be able to automatically detect the game if you point it at the right directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>extract_mm_c64</code> from the tools package to extract the data files. But then the game will not be properly autodetected by ScummVM, and you must make sure that the platform is set to Commodore64. We recommend using the much simpler approach described in the previous paragraph.</p>
<h3 id="329-macintosh-games-notes">3.29) Macintosh games notes</h3>
<p>All LucasArts SCUMM based adventures, except COMI, also exist in versions for the Macintosh. ScummVM can use most (all?) of them, however, in some cases some additional work is required. First off, if you are not using a Macintosh for this, accessing the CD/floppy data might be tricky. The reason for this is that the mac uses a special disk format called HFS which other systems usually do not support. However, there are various free tools which allow reading such HFS volumes. For example <code>HFSExplorer</code> for Windows and <code>hfsutils</code> for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.</p>
<p>Most of the newer games on the Macintosh shipped with only a single data file (note that in some cases this data file was made invisible, so you may need extra tools in order to copy it). ScummVM is able to directly use such a data file; simply point ScummVM at the directory containing it, and it should work (just like with every other supported game).</p>
<p>We also provide a tool called <code>extract_scumm_mac</code> in the tools package to extract the data from these data files, but this is neither required nor recommended.</p>
<p>For further information on copying Macintosh game files to your hard disk see:</p>

<p>In the Macintosh port, the right mouse button is emulated via Cmd-Click (that is, you click the mouse button while holding the Command/Apple/Propeller key).</p>
<p>There are unofficial ports to a variety of platforms, including the Xbox, and Xbox 360. Please note that these are not made by us, so we neither endorse nor can we support them. Use at your own risk!</p>
<h2 id="50-running-scummvm">5.0) Running ScummVM</h2>
<p>Please note that by default, ScummVM will save games in the directory it is executed from, so you should refrain from running it from more than one location. Further information, including how to specify a specific save directory to avoid this issue, are in section 6.0.</p>
<p>ScummVM can be launched directly by running the executable. In this case, the built-in launcher will activate. From this, you can add games (click 'Add Game'), or launch games which have already been configured. Games can also be added in mass quantities. By pressing shift + 'Add Game' (Note that the image turns to 'Mass Add'), you can then specify a directory to start in, and ScummVM will attempt to detect games in all subdirectories of that directory.</p>
<p>ScummVM can also be launched into a game directly using Command Line arguments -- see the next section.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The meaning of most long options (that is, those options starting with a double-dash) can be inverted by prefixing them with "no-". For example, <code>--no-aspect-ratio</code> will turn aspect ratio correction off. This is useful if you want to override a setting in the configuration file.</p>
<p>The short game name ('game target') you see at the end of the command line specifies which game is started. It either corresponds to an arbitrary user defined target (from the configuration file), or to a built-in gameid. A brief list of the latter can be found in section 3.0.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Win32: Running Monkey Island, fullscreen, from a hard disk: <code>C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe -f -pC:\Games\LucasArts\monkey\ scumm:monkey</code> Running Full Throttle from CD, fullscreen and with subtitles enabled: <code>C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe -f -n -pD:\resource\ scumm:ft</code></p></li>
<li><p>Unix: Running Monkey Island, fullscreen, from a hard disk: <code>/path/to/scummvm -f -p/games/LucasArts/monkey/ scumm:monkey</code> Running Full Throttle from CD, fullscreen and with subtitles enabled: <code>/path/to/scummvm -f -n -p/cdrom/resource/ scumm:ft</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="52-global-menu">5.2) Global Menu</h3>
<p>The Global Menu is a general menu which is available to all of the game engines by pressing Ctrl-F5. From this menu there are the following buttons: Resume, Options, About, Return to Launcher, and Quit. Selecting <code>Options</code> will display a dialog where basic audio settings, such as volume levels, can be adjusted. Selecting 'Return to Launcher' will close the current game and return the user back to the ScummVM Launcher, where another game may be selected to play.</p>
<p>Note: Returning to the Launcher is not supported by all of the engines, and the button will be disabled in the Global Menu if it is not supported.</p>

<h3 id="53-graphics-filters">5.3) Graphics filters</h3>
<p>ScummVM offers several anti-aliasing filters to attempt to improve visual quality. These are the same filters used in many other emulators, such as MAME. These filters take the original game graphics, and scale it by a certain fixed factor (usually 2x or 3x) before displaying them to you. So for example, if the game originally run at a resolution of 320x200 (typical for most of the SCUMM games), then using a filter with scale factor 2x will effectively yield 640x400 graphics. Likewise with a 3x filter you will get 960x600.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<pre><code>1x         - No filtering, no scaling. Fastest.
2x         - No filtering, factor 2x (default for non 640x480 games).
3x         - No filtering, factor 3x.
2xsai      - 2xSAI filter, factor 2x.
super2xsai - Enhanced 2xSAI filtering, factor 2x.
supereagle - Less blurry than 2xSAI, but slower. Factor 2x.
advmame2x  - Doesn&#39;t rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 2x.
advmame3x  - Doesn&#39;t rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 3x.
hq2x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 2x.
hq3x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 3x.
tv2x       - Interlace filter, tries to emulate a TV. Factor 2x.
dotmatrix  - Dot matrix effect. Factor 2x.
</code></pre>
<p>To select a graphics filter, select it in the Launcher, or pass its name via the '-g' option to scummvm, for example:</p>
<pre><code>scummvm -gadvmame2x scumm:monkey2
</code></pre>
<p>Note #1: Not all backends support all (or even any) of the filters listed above; some may support additional ones. The filters listed above are those supported by the default SDL backend.</p>
<p>Note #2: Filters can be very slow when ScummVM is compiled in a debug configuration without optimizations. And there is always a speed impact when using any form of anti-aliasing/linear filtering.</p>
<p>Note #3: The FM-TOWNS version of Zak McKracken uses an original resolution of 320x240, hence for this game scalers will scale to 640x480 or 960x720. Likewise, games that originally were using 640x480 (such as Curse of Monkey Island or Broken Sword) will be scaled to 1280x960 and 1920x1440.</p>
<h3 id="54-hotkeys">5.4) Hotkeys</h3>
<p>ScummVM supports various in-game hotkeys. They differ between SCUMM games and other games.</p>
<pre><code>  Common:
    Ctrl-F5                - Displays the Global Menu
    Cmd-q                  - Quit (Mac OS X)
    Ctrl-q                 - Quit (other unices including Linux)
    Alt-F4                 - Quit (Windows)
    Ctrl-z                 - Quit (other platforms)
    Ctrl-u                 - Mute all sounds
    Ctrl-m                 - Toggle mouse capture
    Ctrl-Alt 1-8           - Switch between graphics filters
    Ctrl-Alt + and -       - Increase/Decrease the scale factor
    Ctrl-Alt a             - Toggle aspect-ratio correction on/off
                             Most of the games use a 320x200 pixel
                             resolution, which may look squashed on
                             modern monitors. Aspect-ratio correction
                             stretches the image to use 320x240 pixels
                             instead, or a multiple thereof
    Ctrl-Alt f             - Enable/disable graphics filtering
    Ctrl-Alt s             - Cycle through scaling modes
    Alt-Enter              - Toggles full screen/windowed
    Alt-s                  - Make a screenshot (SDL backend only)
    Ctrl-F7                - Open virtual keyboard (if enabled)
                             This can also be triggered by a long press
                             of the middle mouse button or wheel.

  SCUMM:
    Alt-x                  - Quit

<p>Note that using Ctrl-f or Ctrl-g is not recommended: games can crash when being run faster than their normal speed, as scripts will lose synchronisation.</p>
<h3 id="55-language-options">5.5) Language options</h3>
<p>ScummVM includes a language option for Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken, The Dig, The Curse of Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky and Broken Sword.</p>
<p>Note that with the exception of Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword, multilanguage versions of Goblins games and Nippon Safes Inc., using this option does <em>not</em> change the language of the game (which usually is hardcoded), but rather is only used to select the appropriate font (e.g. for a German version of a game, one containing umlauts).</p>
<p>An exception are The Dig and The Curse of Monkey Island -- non-English versions can be set to 'English.' This however only affects subtitles; game speech will remain the same.</p>

<h2 id="60-saved-games">6.0) Saved Games</h2>
<p>Saved games are by default put in the current directory on some platforms and preset directories on others. You can specify the save in the config file by setting the savepath parameter. See the example config file later in this README.</p>
<p>The platforms that currently have a different default directory are:</p>
<p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong></p>
<p><code>$HOME/Documents/ScummVM Savegames/</code></p>
<p><strong>Other unices:</strong></p>
<p>We follow the XDG Base Directory Specification. This means by default saved games can be found in: <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/scummvm/saves/</code></p>
<p>If <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code> is not defined or empty, <code>~/.local/share</code> will be used as value of <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code> in accordance with the specification.</p>
<p>If an earlier version of ScummVM was installed on your system, the previous default location of <code>~/.scummvm</code> will be kept. This is detected based on the presence of the path <code>~/.scummvm</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Vista/7:</strong></p>
<p><code>\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ScummVM\Saved games\</code></p>
<p><strong>Windows 2000/XP:</strong></p>
<p><code>\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\ScummVM\Saved games\</code></p>
<p><strong>Windows NT4:</strong></p>
<p><code>&lt;windir&gt;\Profiles\username\Application Data\ScummVM\Saved games\</code></p>
<p>Saved games are stored under a hidden area in Windows NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7, which can be accessed by running <code>%APPDATA%\ScummVM\Saved Games</code> or by enabling hidden files in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Note for Windows NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7 users: The default saved games location changed in ScummVM 1.5.0. The migration batch file can be used to copy saved games from the old default location, to the new default location.</p>
<h3 id="61-autosaves">6.1) Autosaves</h3>
<p>For some games ScummVM will by default automatically save the current state every five minutes (adjustable via the <code>autosave_period</code> config setting). The default autosave slot for many engines is slot 0.</p>
<p>The games/engines listed below have autosave support.</p>
<ul>
<li>AGI games</li>
<li>Beneath a Steel Sky</li>
<li>Bud Tucker in Double Trouble</li>
<li>COMPOSER games</li>
<li>Flight of the Amazon Queen</li>
<li>Myst</li>
<li>Riven</li>
<li>SCUMM games</li>
<li>The Legend of Kyrandia I (slot 999)</li>
<li>ZVISION games</li>
</ul>
<p>For the SCUMM engine, this saved game can then be loaded again via Ctrl-0, or the F5 menu.</p>
<h3 id="62-converting-saved-games">6.2) Converting Saved Games</h3>
<p>Using saved games from original versions isn't supported by all game engines. Only the following games can use saved games from their original versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blade Runner</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the debugger console and command "save" to save the game to the original format and command "load" to load such a one</li>
<li>Saved games between different languages are interchangeable</li>
<li>It is not recommended to convert saved games from the version with restored content as they might behave unexpectedly or might cause game breaking bugs</li>

<h2 id="70-music-and-sound">7.0) Music and Sound</h2>
<p>On most operating systems and for most games, ScummVM will by default use MT-32 or AdLib emulation for music playback. MIDI may not be available on all operating systems or may need manual configuration. If you want to use MIDI, you have several different choices of output, depending on your operating system and configuration.</p>
<pre><code>null       - Null output. Don&#39;t play any music.

adlib      - Internal AdLib emulation
fluidsynth - FluidSynth MIDI emulation
mt32       - Internal MT-32 emulation
pcjr       - Internal PCjr emulation (only usable in SCUMM games)
pcspk      - Internal PC Speaker emulation
towns      - Internal FM-TOWNS YM2612 emulation
             (only usable in SCUMM FM-TOWNS games)

<p>To select a sound driver, select it in the Launcher, or pass its name via the <code>-e</code> option to scummvm, for example:</p>
<p><code>scummvm -eadlib scumm:monkey2</code></p>
<h3 id="71-adlib-emulation">7.1) AdLib emulation</h3>
<p>By default an AdLib card will be emulated and ScummVM will output the music as sampled waves. This is the default mode for several games, and offers the best compatibility between machines and games.</p>
<h3 id="72-fluidsynth-midi-emulation">7.2) FluidSynth MIDI emulation</h3>
<p>If ScummVM was build with libfluidsynth support it will be able to play MIDI music through the FluidSynth driver. You will have to specify a SoundFont to use, however.</p>
<p>Since the default output volume from FluidSynth can be fairly low, ScummVM will set the gain by default to get a stronger signal. This can be further adjusted using the <code>--midi-gain</code> command-line option, or the <code>midi_gain</code> config file setting.</p>
<p>The setting can take any value from 0 through 1000, with the default being 100. (This corresponds to FluidSynth's gain settings of 0.0 through 10.0, which are presumably measured in decibel.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The processor requirements for FluidSynth can be fairly high in some cases. A fast CPU is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="73-mt-32-emulation">7.3) MT-32 emulation</h3>
<p>Some games which contain MIDI music data also have improved tracks designed for the MT-32 sound module. ScummVM can now emulate this device, however you must provide original MT-32 ROMs to make it work:</p>
<p><code>MT32_PCM.ROM</code> - IC21 (512KB) <code>MT32_CONTROL.ROM</code> - IC26 (32KB) and IC27 (32KB), interleaved byte-wise</p>
<p>Place these ROMs in the game directory, in your extrapath, or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides.</p>
<p>You don't need to specify <code>--native-mt32</code> with this driver, as it automatically gets turned on.</p>
<p>NOTE: The processor requirements for the emulator are quite high; a fast CPU is strongly recommended.</p>
<h3 id="74-midi-emulation">7.4) MIDI emulation</h3>
<p>Some games (such as Sam &amp; Max) only contain MIDI music data. This once prevented music for these games from working on platforms that do not support MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI drivers (e.g. many soundcards will not play MIDI under Linux). ScummVM can now emulate MIDI mode using sampled waves and AdLib, FluidSynth MIDI emulation or MT-32 emulation using the <code>-eadlib</code>, <code>-efluidsynth</code> or <code>-emt32</code> options respectively. However, if you are capable of using native MIDI, we recommend using one of the MIDI modes below for best sound.</p>
<h3 id="75-native-midi-support">7.5) Native MIDI support</h3>
<p>Use the appropriate <code>-e&lt;mode&gt;</code> command line option from the list above to select your preferred MIDI device. For example, if you wish to use the Windows MIDI driver, use the <code>-ewindows</code> option.</p>
<h4 id="751-using-midi-options-to-customize-native-midi-output">7.5.1) Using MIDI options to customize Native MIDI output</h4>
<p>ScummVM supports a variety of MIDI modes, depending on the capabilities of your MIDI device.</p>
<p>If <code>--native-mt32</code> is specified, ScummVM will treat your device as a real MT-32. Because the instrument mappings and system exclusive commands of the MT-32 vary from those of General MIDI devices, you should only enable this option if you are using an actual Roland MT-32, LAPC-I, CM-64, CM-32L, CM-500, or GS device with an MT-32 map.</p>
<p>If <code>--enable-gs</code> is specified, ScummVM will initialize your GS-compatible device with settings that mimic the MT-32's reverb, (lack of) chorus, pitch bend sensitivity, etc. If it is specified in conjunction with <code>--native-mt32</code>, ScummVM will select the MT-32-compatible map and drumset on your GS device. This setting works better than default GM or GS emulation with games that do not have custom instrument mappings (Loom and Monkey1). You should only specify both settings if you are using a GS device that has an MT-32 map, such as an SC-55, SC-88, SC-88 Pro, SC-8820, SC-8850, etc. Please note that <code>--enable-gs</code> is automatically disabled in both DOTT and Samnmax, since they use General MIDI natively.</p>
<p>If neither of the above settings is enabled, ScummVM will initialize your device in General MIDI mode and use GM emulation in games with MT-32 soundtracks.</p>
<p>Some games contain sound effects that are exclusive to the AdLib soundtrack. For these games, you may wish to specify <code>--multi-midi</code> in order to combine MIDI music with AdLib sound effects.</p>
<h3 id="76-unix-native-alsa-and-dmedia-sequencer-support">7.6) UNIX native, ALSA and dmedia sequencer support</h3>
<p>If your soundcard driver supports a sequencer, you may set the environment variable <code>SCUMMVM_MIDI</code> to your sequencer device -- for example, to /dev/sequencer</p>
<p>If you have problems with not hearing audio in this configuration, you may need to set the environment variable <code>SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT</code> to 1 or 2. This selects the port on the selected sequencer to use. Then start scummvm with the <code>-eseq</code> parameter. This should work on several cards, and may offer better performance and quality than AdLib emulation. However, for those systems where sequencer support does not work, you can always fall back on AdLib emulation.</p>
<h4 id="761-alsa-sequencer-unix-only">7.6.1) ALSA sequencer [UNIX ONLY]</h4>
<p>If you have installed the ALSA driver with sequencer support, then you may set the environment variable <code>SCUMMVM_PORT</code> or the config file variable <code>alsa_port</code> to specify your sequencer port. If neither is set, the default behavior is to try both "65:0" and "17:0".</p>
<p>Here is a brief guide on how to use the ALSA sequencer with your soundcard. In all cases, to obtain a list of all the sequencer ports you have, try the command <code>aconnect -o -l</code>. This should give output similar to:</p>
<pre><code>    client 14: &#39;Midi Through&#39; [type=kernel]
        0 &#39;Midi Through Port-0&#39;
    client 16: &#39;SBLive! Value [CT4832]&#39; [type=kernel]
        0 &#39;EMU10K1 MPU-401 (UART)&#39;
    client 17: &#39;Emu10k1 WaveTable&#39; [type=kernel]
        0 &#39;Emu10k1 Port 0  &#39;
        1 &#39;Emu10k1 Port 1  &#39;
        2 &#39;Emu10k1 Port 2  &#39;
        3 &#39;Emu10k1 Port 3  &#39;
    client 128: &#39;TiMidity&#39; [type=user]
        0 &#39;TiMidity port 0 &#39;
        1 &#39;TiMidity port 1 &#39;
        2 &#39;TiMidity port 2 &#39;
        3 &#39;TiMidity port 3 &#39;
</code></pre>
<p>The most important bit here is that there are four WaveTable MIDI outputs located at 17:0, 17:1, 17:2 and 17:3, and four TiMidity ports located at 128:0, 128:1, 128:2 and 128:3.</p>
<p>If you have a FM-chip on your card, like the SB16, then you have to load the SoundFonts using the sbiload software. Example:</p>
<pre><code>sbiload -p 17:0 /etc/std.o3 /etc/drums.o3
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a WaveTable capable sound card, you have to load a sbk or sf2 SoundFont using the sfxload or asfxload software. Example:</p>
<pre><code>sfxload /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have a MIDI capable soundcard, there are two options: FluidSynth and TiMidity. We recommend FluidSynth, as on many systems TiMidity will 'lag' behind music. This is very noticeable in iMUSE-enabled games, which use fast and dynamic music transitions. Running TiMidity as root will allow it to setup real time priority, which may reduce music lag.</p>
<p>Asking TiMidity to become an ALSA sequencer:</p>
<pre><code>timidity -iAqqq -B2,8 -Os1S -s 44100 &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>(If you get distorted output with this setting, you can try dropping the -B2,8 or changing the value.)</p>
<p>Asking FluidSynth to become an ALSA sequencer (using SoundFonts):</p>
<pre><code>fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2
</code></pre>
<p>Once either TiMidity or FluidSynth are running, use the 'aconnect -o -l' command as described earlier in this section.</p>
<h4 id="762-irix-dmedia-sequencer-unix-only">7.6.2) IRIX dmedia sequencer: [UNIX ONLY]</h4>
<p>If you are using IRIX and the dmedia driver with sequencer support, you can set the environment variable <code>SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT</code> or the config file variable <code>dmedia_port</code> to specify your sequencer port. The default is to use the first port.</p>
<p>To get a list of configured midi interfaces on your system, run "startmidi" without parameters. Example output:</p>
<pre><code>  2 MIDI interfaces configured:
          Serial Port 2
          Software Synth
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you can configure ScummVM to use the "Software Synth" instead of the default "Serial Port 2" by adding a line</p>
<pre><code>dmedia_port=Software Synth
</code></pre>
<p>to your configuration file in the section [scummvm], or setting <code>SCUMMVM_PORT=Software Synth</code> in your environment.</p>
<h3 id="77-timidity-midi-server-support">7.7) TiMidity++ MIDI server support</h3>
<p>If your system lacks any MIDI sequencer, but you still want better MIDI quality than default AdLib emulation can offer, you can try the TiMidity++ MIDI server. See <a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">http://timidity.sourceforge.net/</a> for download and install instructions.</p>
<p>First, you need to start a daemon:</p>
<pre><code>timidity -ir 7777
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can start ScummVM and try selection TiMidity music output. By default, it will connect to localhost:7777, but you can change host/port via the <code>TIMIDITY_HOST</code> environment variable. You can also specify a "device number" using the <code>SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT</code> environment variable.</p>
<h3 id="78-using-compressed-audio-files">7.8) Using compressed audio files</h3>
<h4 id="781-using-mp3-files-for-cd-audio">7.8.1) Using MP3 files for CD audio</h4>
<p>Use LAME or some other MP3 encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files. Name the files track1.mp3 track2.mp3 etc. ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support to use this option. You will need to rip the file from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the MP3 files in constant bit rate. This can be done with the following LAME command line:</p>
<pre><code>lame -t -q 0 -b 96 track1.wav track1.mp3
</code></pre>
<h4 id="782-using-ogg-vorbis-files-for-cd-audio">7.8.2) Using Ogg Vorbis files for CD audio</h4>
<p>Use oggenc or some other vorbis encoder to encode the audio tracks to files. Name the files track1.ogg track2.ogg etc. ScummVM must be compiled with vorbis support to use this option. You will need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the vorbis files. This can be done with the following oggenc command line with the value after q specifying the desired quality from 0 to 10:</p>
<pre><code>oggenc -q 5 track1.wav
</code></pre>
<h4 id="783-using-flac-files-for-cd-audio">7.8.3) Using Flac files for CD audio</h4>
<p>Use flac or some other flac encoder to encode the audio tracks to files. Name the files track1.flac track2.flac etc. If your filesystem only allows three letter extensions, name the files track1.fla track2.fla etc. ScummVM must be compiled with flac support to use this option. You will need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the flac files. This can be done with the following flac command line:</p>
<pre><code>flac --best track1.wav
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options will only affect the encoding time and resulting filesize.</p>
<h4 id="784-compressing-monstersou-with-mp3">7.8.4) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with MP3</h4>
<p>You need LAME, and our <code>compress_scumm_sou</code> utility from the scummvm-tools package to perform this task, and ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support.</p>
<pre><code>compress_scumm_sou monster.sou
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually you will have a much smaller monster.so3 file, copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the monster.sou file.</p>
<h4 id="785-compressing-monstersou-with-ogg-vorbis">7.8.5) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Ogg Vorbis</h4>
<p>As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with OGG support. Run:</p>
<pre><code>compress_scumm_sou --vorbis monster.sou
</code></pre>
<p>This should produce a smaller monster.sog file, which you should copy to your game directory. Ogg encoding may take a considerable longer amount of time than MP3, so have a good book handy.</p>
<h4 id="786-compressing-monstersou-with-flac">7.8.6) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Flac</h4>
<p>As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with Flac support. Run:</p>
<pre><code>compress_scumm_sou --flac monster.sou
</code></pre>
<p>This should produce a smaller monster.sof file, which you should copy to your game directory. Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options will only affect the encoding time and resulting file size. Playing with the blocksize (<code>-b &lt;value&gt;</code>), has the biggest impact on the resulting file size -- 1152 seems to be a good value for those kind of soundfiles. Be sure to read the encoder documentation before you use other values.</p>
<h4 id="787-compressing-musicsfxspeech-in-agos-games">7.8.7) Compressing music/sfx/speech in AGOS games</h4>
<p>Use our <code>compress_agos</code> utility from the scummvm-tools package to perform this task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but note that you can only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the respective decoder support enabled.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>For Flac add <code>--flac</code> and optional parameters, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>compress_agos --flac
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually you will have a much smaller *.mp3, *.ogg or *.fla file, copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old file.</p>
<h4 id="788-compressing-speechmusic-in-broken-sword">7.8.8) Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword</h4>
<p>The <code>compress_sword1</code> tool from the scummvm-tools package can encode music and speech to MP3, Ogg Vorbis as well as Flac. The easiest way to encode the files is simply copying the executable into your BS1 directory (together with the lame encoder) and run it from there. This way, it will automatically encode everything to MP3. Afterwards, you can manually remove the SPEECH?.CLU files and the wave music files.</p>
<p>Running <code>compress_sword1 --vorbis</code> will compress the files using Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3.</p>
<p>Running <code>compress_sword1 --flac</code> will compress the files using Flac instead of MP3.</p>
<p>Use <code>compress_sword1 --help</code> to get a full list of the options.</p>
<h4 id="789-compressing-speechmusic-in-broken-sword-ii">7.8.9) Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword II</h4>
<p>Use our <code>compress_sword2</code> utility from the scummvm-tools package to perform this task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but note that you can only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the respective decoder support enabled.</p>
<pre><code>  compress_sword2 speech1.clu
  compress_sword2 music1.clu
</code></pre>
<p>For Ogg Vorbis add --vorbis to the options, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>compress_sword2 --vorbis
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually you will have a much smaller *.cl3 or *.clg file, copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old file.</p>
<p>It is possible to use Flac compression by adding the <code>--flac</code> option. However, the resulting *.clf file will actually be larger than the original.</p>
<p>Please note that <code>compress_sword2</code> will only work with the four speech/music files in Broken Sword II. It will not work with any of the other *.clu files, nor will it work with the speech files from Broken Sword.</p>
<h3 id="79-output-sample-rate">7.9) Output sample rate</h3>
<p>The output sample rate tells ScummVM how many sound samples to play per channel per second. There is much that could be said on this subject, but most of it would be irrelevant here. The short version is that for most games 22050 Hz is fine, but in some cases 44100 Hz is preferable. On extremely low-end systems you may want to use 11025 Hz, but it is unlikely that you have to worry about that.</p>
<p>To elaborate, most of the sounds ScummVM has to play were sampled at either 22050 Hz or 11025 Hz. Using a higher sample rate will not magically improve the quality of these sounds. Hence, 22050 Hz is fine.</p>
<p>Some games use CD audio. If you use compressed files for this, they are probably sampled at 44100 Hz, so for these games that may be a better choice of sample rate.</p>
<p>When using the AdLib, FM Towns, PC Speaker or IBM PCjr music drivers, ScummVM is responsible for generating the samples. Usually 22050 Hz will be plenty for these, but there is at least one piece of AdLib music in Beneath a Steel Sky that will sound a lot better at 44100 Hz.</p>
<p>Using frequencies in between is not recommended. For one thing, your sound card may not support it. In theory, ScummVM should fall back on a sensible frequency in that case, but don't count on it. More importantly, ScummVM has to resample all sounds to its output frequency. This is much easier to do well if the output frequency is a multiple of the original frequency.</p>

                            8192 16384 32768. The default value is
                            calculated based on the output_rate to keep
                            audio latency below 45ms.

<h3 id="82-custom-game-options-that-can-be-toggled-via-the-gui">8.2) Custom game options that can be toggled via the GUI</h3>
<p>A lot of the custom game options in the previous section can be toggled via the GUI. If a custom option is available for a specific game, a new tab called "Engine" will appear when adding or editing the configuration of that game. If the custom options are not shown, the games in question will need to be run once or readded in the ScummVM launcher's game list. This will update the configuration of each entry, allowing the custom options to be shown.</p>
<h2 id="90-screenshots-sdl-backend-only">9.0) Screenshots (SDL backend only)</h2>
<p>On systems using the SDL backend (for example Windows, Mac or Linux) you can use alt+s to take snapshots (see section 5.4 - Hotkeys).</p>
<p>You can specify the directory in which you want the screenshots to be created in the config file. To do so add a screenshotpath value under the <code>[scummvm]</code> section:</p>
<pre><code>[scummvm]
screenshotpath=/path/to/screenshots/
</code></pre>
<p>The default location, when no screenshot path is defined in the config file, depends on the OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: In <code>Users\username\My Pictures\ScummVM Screenshots</code>.</li>
<li>macOS X: On the Desktop.</li>
<li>Other unices: In the XDG Pictures user directory, e.g. <code>~/Pictures/ScummVM Screenshots</code></li>
<li>Any other OS: In the current directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="100-compiling">10.0) Compiling</h2>
<p>For an up-to-date overview on how to compile ScummVM for various platforms, please consult our Wiki, in particular this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Compiling_ScummVM">https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Compiling_ScummVM</a></p>
<p>If you are compiling for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X, you need SDL-1.2.2 or newer (older versions may work, but are unsupported), and a supported compiler. Several compilers, including GCC, mingw and recent versions of Microsoft Visual C++ are supported. If you wish to use MP3-compressed CD tracks or .SOU files, you will need to install the MAD library; likewise you will need the appropriate libraries for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC compressed sound. For compressed save states, zlib is required.</p>
<p>Some parts of ScummVM, particularly scalers, have highly optimized versions written in assembler. If you wish to use this option, you will need to install nasm assembler (see <a href="https://www.nasm.us/">https://www.nasm.us/</a>). Note that we currently only have x86 MMX optimized versions, and they will not compile on other processors.</p>
<p>On Windows, you can define <code>USE_WINDBG</code> and attach WinDbg to browse debug messages (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/index">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/index</a>).</p>
